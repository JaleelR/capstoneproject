The title of my site is called motivator App and it is deployed here: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-cjjr93njbvhs73bnskgg/deploys/dep-cjjrm3ocfp5c73a58000

The Motivator App is a space created for people who needs/wants more inspiring, self-improving and or motivating people and enviroment around them. Through these other social media platforms and news outlets it's almost always negative, wouldn't it be cool if there was an platform where it was always postive and interactive? This is what the Motivator App is made for

The features I implemented are as followed:
1. Being able to create a account
2. Being able to create a post
3. Allowing a user to like a post
4. Having motivating videos and news articles

I decided to have user create an account and create posts because I wanted to create an community where people can encourage and support eachother. Whenever you need some inspiration or motivation you can just look at your previous post, others post or even your likes!
Lastly, I thought it extremely important to add videos and news articles because everyone receives information differenlty. Sometimes a user posting motivating posts may not be effective to everyone. So adding videos and articles where they tell stories will give people a variety of different ways to be able to be inspired or motivated. 

The user will be prompted to register or login. After login, the user will be brought to the home page where the user can now view posts of others, create posts and view inspiring videos and news articles. The user will also be able to like those posts. There is also a button that will allow you to visit your own page on the home page. Once that is clicked, The user will have their own detailed page, displaying their name, username, profile picture, posts, likes button and edit profile button. In the users details page, on where the user posts there is a edit button where you can edit a post you created. The edit profile button allows the user to chage their username and profile picture. The likes button allows you to see all the posts and news articles you liked.
